# Machine Failure Prediction

This project is a Flask-based application to predict machine failures using a trained Random Forest model. Users can input machine data via a web form, and the app predicts whether the machine will fail based on the input.

## Features
- User-friendly web interface to input machine data.
- Prediction of machine failure using a pre-trained Random Forest model.
- Interactive results page displaying the prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training is **not realistic**. It was generated using [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) for testing purposes only. It includes features such as:
- `Operating_Hours`
- `Vibration_Level (mm/s)`
- `Maintenance_Overdue (days)`
- `Tool_Wear (mm)`
- `Ambient_Temperature (Â°C)`

## How to Use
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local system:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/M1ndSmith/machine-failure-prediction.git
cd machine-failure-prediction
